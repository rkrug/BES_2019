## Abstract

With an increasing call for FAIR data management, metadata, and it's quality, plays an ever increasing role. Nevertheless, providing metadata is a task, not easily accomplished. One of the reasons for this is the cumbersome way of entering metadata in the formats or webforms needed by the repositories. In addition, there may be little or no quality control of the entered metadata. Last but not least, the metadata schemes used by the repositories are either restricted to bibliometric metadata (e.g. general repositories) or are using metadata schemes which have to cover a vast diversity of different data (e.g. EML or Darwin Core). 

I will present an approach which uses domain specific metadata schemes to overcome these problems, by developing these schemes together with scientists of their specific domain. The approach can be employed without detailed technical knowledge, e.g. by using spreadsheets and a web browser. The approach should help researchers recognise the value of metadata for their own research (as well as for sharing), particularly if used at the beginning of a research project, while data collection methods are designed. The provided validation tool can be used to increase quality of data before it is used for one's own research.
